Know Your Rights is an AI-powered legal assistant that helps users understand their rights under the **Indian Penal Code (IPC)**. The chatbot provides information on fundamental rights, legal procedures, and human rights protections using a knowledge base of Indian legal documents. You can simply ask a question in plain language — like whether a certain action is a crime or what a specific law means — and the chatbot will provide a clear, structured explanation, including punishments, examples, and related laws. Whether you're a student, a concerned citizen, or just curious about your rights, this tool makes complex legal information easy to access and understand.

## How It Works
 1. **PDF Preprocessing:** IPC PDFs are loaded and split into chunks. Each chunk is converted into numerical embeddings using HuggingFace (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
 2. **Vector Storage (FAISS):** The embeddings are stored in FAISS, a fast vector database that allows semantic search.
 3. **User Input via Streamlit:** Users ask legal questions through a chat interface built with Streamlit.
 4. **Semantic Retrieval:** The question is embedded and compared to the FAISS index to fetch the most relevant IPC sections.
 5. **Initial Response (LLM 1):** A lightweight local model (Flan-T5) generates a basic natural language answer from the retrieved content.
 6. **Structured Formatting (LLM 2):** The answer is passed to Gemini 1.5 Flash, which reformats it into a clean legal structure that is easily understood.
 7. **Conversational Memory:** Using LangChain’s memory module, chat history is preserved for follow-up questions.

## Detailed Tech Stack
### 1. **Streamlit**
- **Why:** Provides a fast, interactive, and easy-to-use web interface for Python applications.
- **How:** Used to build the chatbot UI, display responses, and manage user input/output in real time.
### 2. **PyPDF2**
- **Why:** Efficiently extracts text from PDF documents.
- **How:** Parses the IPC and other legal PDFs, splitting them into manageable text chunks for further processing.
### 3. **Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)**
- **Why:** Converts text into dense vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning.
- **How:** Each chunk of legal text is embedded so that similar questions and legal sections are close in vector space, enabling semantic search.
### 4. **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**
- **Why:** Provides fast and scalable similarity search over large collections of vectors.
- **How:** Stores all legal text embeddings, allowing the system to quickly retrieve the most relevant sections for any user query.
### 5. **Flan-T5 (google/flan-t5-small)**
- **Why:** Lightweight, open-source LLM fine-tuned for instruction following and question answering.
- **How:** Generates initial answers to user questions based on the retrieved legal text, ensuring responses are relevant and concise.
### 6. **Gemini 1.5 Flash (via Google API)**
- **Why:** Advanced LLM capable of understanding context and *formatting complex information.**
- **How:** Reformats the initial answer into a structured, easy-to-understand legal summary (with punishments, explanations, and examples).
### 7. **LangChain**
- **Why:** Simplifies LLM orchestration, memory management, and chaining multiple models.
- **How:** Maintains conversational memory, manages prompt templates, and coordinates the flow between retrieval, answer generation, and formatting.
### 8. **python-dotenv**
- **Why:** Securely manages API keys and environment variables.
- **How:** Loads sensitive credentials (like the Gemini API key) from a `.env` file, keeping them out of source code.
### 9. **FAISS Index Preprocessing Script**
- **Why:** Precomputes and stores vector embeddings for all legal documents.
- **How:** `process_pdfs.py` reads PDFs, splits them, embeds each chunk, and saves the FAISS index for fast runtime retrieval.
### 10. **Helper Scripts (src/helper.py, formatter.py)**
- **Why:** Modularizes code for embedding, retrieval, and formatting logic.
- **How:** 
  - `helper.py` handles embedding and semantic search.
  - `formatter.py` uses Gemini to structure the output.

## 🔧 Installation Guide
### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone [https://github.com/Sam221104/Know-Your-Rights.git](https://github.com/Sam221104/Know-Your-Rights.git)
cd Know-Your-Rights
```
### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
On Windows:
```
python -m venv .venv
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
.venv\Scripts\Activate
```
On macOS/Linux:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Add Your API Key
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following:
```GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here```
### 5. Preprocess Legal PDFs for faster response
```
python process_pdfs.py
```
This reads IPC PDFs from the docs/ folder and builds a FAISS index using HuggingFace embeddings.
### 6. Run the Application
```
streamlit run app.py
```
#### This launches the interface at ```http://localhost:8501.```
